# HackHi

This is the code from my teams submission in the Humana Hackathon for interns. The code in this repo is all the code I wrote for the project. The full source is under a different private repo.

The project utilized the tesseract library for OCR capabilities. The goal of the project was to read grocery receipts and determine whether or not the user was purchasing healthy foods.
